## Notes

This was actually one of my first times using a Mac at all. I have always been Windows laptops, so getting used to the general layout, commands, and navigation
was something that I needed to get used to. Other than this, it was not too difficult of an app to create, but it was my first time working with Xcode as well.
Xcode in general can be overwhelming as pressing one wrong button can take you down a long loop of trying to figure out where you went wrong, so the trial
and error is the main reason this entire process took around 5 hours.
